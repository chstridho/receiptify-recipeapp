Receiptify Documentation
Overview
Receiptify is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users discover and explore a variety of food recipes through a user-friendly interface. The application leverages an external recipe API to fetch and display recipes, allowing users to search for dishes based on ingredients, cuisine, dietary preferences, or other criteria. Receiptify aims to simplify the process of finding and preparing meals by providing detailed recipe information in an accessible and engaging format.
This documentation provides an overview of the Receiptify application, including its features, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. It is intended for developers, contributors, and users who wish to understand or extend the functionality of the application.

Features
Receiptify offers the following core features:

Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes by keywords, ingredients, or cuisine type.
Detailed Recipe Information: Displays comprehensive recipe details, including ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, and nutritional information (if provided by the API).
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive UI built with Flutter for a seamless cross-platform experience on iOS and Android.
API-Driven Content: Integrates with a third-party recipe API to fetch real-time recipe data.
Favorites (Optional): Allows users to save their favorite recipes for quick access (if implemented).
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and orientations.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Backend: Third-party recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular, Edamam, or similar)
State Management: Provider or Riverpod (assumed based on typical Flutter project structure)
HTTP Client: Dio or http package for API requests
Platform: Cross-platform (iOS and Android)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To set up and run the Receiptify application, ensure you have the following installed:

Flutter SDK: Version 3.0.0 or higher
Dart: Included with Flutter
IDE: Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart plugins
Emulator/Simulator: Android Emulator or iOS Simulator for testing
API Key: An API key from a recipe API provider (e.g., Spoonacular, Edamam)
Git: For cloning the repository
Terminal/Shell: For running Flutter commands

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/chstridho/receiptify-recipeapp.git
cd receiptify-recipeapp


Install Dependencies:Run the following command to fetch the required Flutter packages:
flutter pub get


Set Up API Key:

Obtain an API key from your chosen recipe API provider.
Create a configuration file (e.g., lib/config/api_config.dart) or update the existing configuration to include your API key. Ensure this file is excluded from version control (e.g., added to .gitignore) to protect sensitive information.

Example api_config.dart:
const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
const String apiBaseUrl = 'https://api.example.com/v1';


Run the Application:Connect a device or start an emulator/simulator, then run:
flutter run



Configuration

API Configuration: Ensure the API base URL and key are correctly set in the configuration file. The application uses these to make HTTP requests to the recipe API.
Environment Variables: For security, avoid hardcoding sensitive data. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management approach.
Customization: Modify the UI theme, colors, or layout in the lib directory (e.g., theme.dart or similar) to match your branding or preferences.

Usage

Launch the App: Open the app on your device or emulator.
Search for Recipes: Use the search bar to enter keywords (e.g., "chicken", "vegan", "Italian") to find relevant recipes.
View Recipe Details: Tap on a recipe to view its ingredients, instructions, and other details.
Save Favorites (Optional): If implemented, use the "Favorite" button to save recipes for later.
Explore Categories: Browse recipes by categories like cuisine type or dietary needs (if supported by the API and UI).

Project Structure
The repository follows a standard Flutter project structure. Below is an overview of the key directories and files (excluding any sensitive files like credentials):

├── README.md                 # Basic project information
└── .gitignore                # Files and folders to exclude from version control

Note: Sensitive files (e.g., API keys, credentials) are assumed to be excluded from the repository via .gitignore. Do not include or share such files in public repositories.
API Integration
Receiptify integrates with a third-party recipe API to fetch recipe data. The API service is typically implemented in the lib/services/ directory, using a package like http or dio for HTTP requests. The general flow is as follows:

API Request: The app sends a request to the API with parameters like search query, cuisine, or dietary restrictions.
Response Handling: The API returns JSON data, which is parsed into Dart models (e.g., Recipe, Ingredient) defined in lib/models/.
UI Update: The parsed data is displayed in the app’s UI using Flutter widgets.

Example API service (lib/services/api_service.dart):
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';
import '../config/api_config.dart';

class ApiService {
  Future<List<dynamic>> searchRecipes(String query) async {
    final response = await http.get(
      Uri.parse('$apiBaseUrl/recipes/search?query=$query&apiKey=$apiKey'),
    );
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      return jsonDecode(response.body)['results'];
    } else {
      throw Exception('Failed to load recipes');
    }
  }
}

Note: Replace the API endpoint and parameters with those specific to your chosen recipe API.
